description Zambia National Cancer Registry was established by the Medical Research Council in November 1977 under the supervision of the Ministry of Health Headquarters. In early 1982 the Registry was transferred from the Ministry of Health to University Teaching Hospital (UTH). A full time supervisor for the registry was appointed in 2014. Dr. Richard Nsakanya has an MPH (2009) and has worked on AIDS control and health systems management in Zambia. He is based in the Disease Surveillance & Monitoring Department in the Ministry of Health. The registry is located in an office on the first floor of the Paediatric Centre of Excellence at University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka.Death Registration is carried out in the Department of National Registration. Deaths are registered by district, based on death certificates, completed by medical staff in hospital mortuaries (to which home deaths are taken). The information on cause of death is often poorly recorded, and may be inaccurate for home deaths, of which the certifying doctor will have had little direct information.The registry has migrated from CANREG4 to CANREG5. The CANREG data entry closely follows the Notification Form (with the exception of not including the info on tobacco and alcohol, or on occupation). The registry staffs have completed a first cancer registry report which included writing section of the report and analysing cancer incidence rates for the time period 2008 to 2012 using the population projection based on census 2010
