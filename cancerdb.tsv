actcr-au	ACTCR	10	registry			https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/health-conditions-disability-deaths/cancer/overview	The ACT Cancer Registry (ACTCR) registers all new cases of cancer diagnosed in ACT residents (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and all deaths of people with cancer to gain a comprehensive picture of the burden of cancer across the population. It is managed by the ACT Health Directorate. The ACT CR is a case-based registry in which all notifications relating to a particular case of cancer are linked to form a single record. A case of cancer is the occurrence of a malignant neoplasm in a particular person. Therefore a case of malignant melanoma in a particular person counts as one case. If the same person subsequently develops leukaemia, the leukaemia counts as a second case. The CHeReL has incorporated ACT CR data from 1994 into the Master Linkage Key. It is possible to obtain ACT CR data back to 1982, but the CHeReL and ACT CR data custodian recommend using data from 1994 for linkage studies.  From 1982 to 1994 the quality of the linkage is likely to be compromised by missing or estimated dates of birth, and incomplete pathology reports.  Researchers should therefore exercise caution if interpreting results including pre 1994 data.																						https://www.cherel.org.au/media/20534/act_cr_data_dictionary_20170123.docx																1982																							Australia

crwb-dz	CRWB	10	registry				The cancer registry of the wilaya of Batna has started on January 1, 1995, codified by the international center for research on cancer (IARC) under number 524. Its objectives are the calculation of gross and standardized incidences of cancers in both sexes, to measure the importance of the most frequent cancers, their secular trends and a comparison with data from other national registers and international organizations, to help in the decision-making of the implementation of the national cancer plan 2015-2019 and its evaluation by performance indicators results and process.Cancer register in the Wilaya of Batna is a population based register that covers 1,173,852 inhabitants in 2011 (estimate made with a rate of population increase of 1.58% beginning from the 2008 RGPH census). A total number of 768 new cases has been identified, which represents a standardized incidence of 78.2 cases per 100,000. The most prevalent cancers in males were lung cancer (12.2 cases / 100,000 population), colorectal cancers and bladder cancers, respectively. In females, breast cancer was largely the most prevalent type, representing 30% of the total cancers, followed by colorectal cancers and thyroid cancer. In children aged 0 to 14, the standardized prevalence was 1.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, largely dominated by malignant blood and lymphoid organs cancers.																						https://web.s.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=2070254X&AN=141057671&h=DgiR%2b9q3lhANC1IyxrhujRLXwGHEZG0a3ZA7dskNWsFwQX1YzDgEzFu3TUqBwf6TtCwio%2fPXJj8O5WbMaS3Q7A%3d%3d&crl=f&resultNs=AdminWebAuth&resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d2070254X%26AN%3d141057671									Cancer Registry Of The Wilaya Of Batna							1995																							Algeria

bbcr-ar	BBCR	9	registry				The Regional Tumor Registry of the South of the Province of Buenos Aires covers the political area of Bahía Blanca, with a population of 290 000 at the 2005 census.Although the registry was recognized by a provincial law and a municipal resolution in 1993, it does not have a speciĺc budget. The Argentine Association for Cancer Prevention and Education (AAPEC), a non-profit organization founded in 19 to improve cancer control, maintains the registry and other high-priority projects, such as the tobacco control programme. Although resources are limited, the registry employs two registrars and a registry coordinator. Most of the registry’s resources are provided by the municipal government of Bahía Blanca.																						https://www.iccp-portal.org/events/35th-annual-meeting-international-association-cancer-registries									Bahía Blanca Cancer Registry							1993																							Argentina

gcr-ug	gcr	9	registry				Gulu cancer registry (GCR) is a population based cancer registry that became operational in June 2014 with support from International Network on Cancer Treatment and Research (INCTR). Given possible environmental factor and ethnic diversity from the Kampala City Registry, Gulu cancer registry was established to assess the burden of cancer in Acholi Sub-region. The registry is located in a semi-urban area at St. Mary’s Hospital Lacor about 7 km west of Gulu town in Northern part of Uganda.Case finding: The cancer registrar actively collects cancer data from all the wards in the source hospitals namely; Lacor Hospital, Gulu Regional Hospital, Gulu Independent hospital, Gulu Military Hospital, Anaka Hospital and all the medical centres and pathology or clinical laboratories in the catchment area. Cancer cases referred to Mulago National Referral Hospital, Uganda Cancer Institute and Radiotherapy units are followed up to have their information updated. All other hospitals and Medical Centres in Kampala where patients from northern Uganda get services are also visited to collect information about the referred patients. Data Coding: Information on each cancer patient is coded using local and universal method of classifications. For instance the coding for topography, morphology and basis of diagnosis are adopted from the ICD-O-3 coding theme. Data Entry and Cleaning: The information is entered into CanReg5, checked for consistently, duplication and errors. Data Analysis: The same software is used for analysis of the data to produce tables and graphs for various cancer incidences and prevalence.																						https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulu_Regional_Cancer_Centre									Gulu Cancer Registry							2014																							Uganda

hawaii-tumor-registry	Hawaiʻi Tumor Registry	9	registry			https://www.uhcancercenter.org/research/shared-resources/hawaii-tumor-registry	The Hawaiʻi Tumor Registry is responsible for cancer surveillance in the state of Hawaiʻi. The HTR was established in 1960 by the Hawaiʻi Medical Association, the Hawaiʻi State Department of Health, and the Hawaiʻi Pacific Division of the American Cancer Society. The HTR has been operated by the University of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center since 1973 when it became a funded registry of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. As one of twenty-two NCI SEER registries nationwide, the HTR collects confidential data on cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. The HTR has been consistently recognized as a high-quality cancer registry, receiving GOLD standard awards from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). HTR cancer data are used to produce cancer incidence and mortality rates in order to track cancer trends in the state and nationally and to serve as a resource for cancer research and public health activities. With Hawaiʻi’s unique multiethnic population, the HTR has played a key role in understanding racial and ethnic differences in the burden of cancer.																																						1960																											https://facebook.com/uhcancercenter		https://instagram.com/uhcancercenter	https://linkedin.com/company/uhcancercenter

kcr-ug	kcr	9	registry				The Kampala Cancer Registry was established in the Department of Pathology of Makerere Faculty of Medicine l (now the College of Health Sciences, Makerere University) in 1951 as a population-based cancer registry with the aim of determining cancer incidence in the population of Kyadondo County.The registry is computerized and data management is carried out using the IARC/IACR CANREG software which includes checks for consistency and validity and permits search for potential duplicate registration. Completeness of registration was evaluated in 2001 as around 90% of adult cancer cases. Confidentiality is taken care of by using only registration numbers during analysis of data. The registry is out of bounds for unauthorized persons.The Kampala Cancer Registry collects data on the population of Kyadondo County, which includes the city of Kampala - the capital of Uganda. The registry provides the longest time series of cancer incidence in Africa. This makes the data of special value for cancer surveillance and research, particularly in monitoring the epidemic of HIV/AIDS and as a baseline for analytical studies and intervention studies. Screening programmes are non existent. However attempts are being made to start cervical cancer screening, and this is because of the reporting in the recent past of high rates of cancer of the cervix in Kyadondo County. A report for the years 2007-2009 was published in August 2012.																						https://afcrn.org/images/Publication/Kampala-report-2010-12.pdf									Kampala Cancer Registry							1954																							Uganda

nccp-al	NCCP-AL	9	registry				The cancer registry is based on hospital records of the “Mother Teresa” University Hospital Center in Tirana (TUHC). The computerization of data has started in 2008. The data collected from 36 districts are then sent to TUHC. The cancer and risk factors surveillance is based on the institutional collaboration between TUHC and the Institute of Public Health. The incidence estimates for this country have a high degree of uncertainty because they are not based on population based cancer registry.																						https://extranet.who.int/ncdccs/Data/ALB_B5_NCCP%20Albania%20English.pdf									The National Cancer Control Program Albania							2011																							Albania

During 2008, the "Confidentiality Directives" were prepared for this registry, in accordance with Provincial Law No. 2399/03, to guarantee the right to honor and privacy of individuals and regulate access to the information that is registered. The Neuquén Registry will be of the Population type since it collects the data on new cases that occur in a resident population in a certain geographical area, an essential requirement to calculate the incidence.																						https://www.hospitalneuquen.org.ar/institucional/sistema-de-salud/registro-de-tumores-del-neuquen/									Neuquén Cancer Registry Argentina							2007																							Argentina																											
ncrsa-za	ncr-sa	9	registry				The NCR-SA was established as pathology-based cancer registry in 1986 by the then South African Institute of Medical Research, Pathology Division, and the Department of Health. Recognised methods of analysis and routine reporting were introduced in 1990 when Dr F Sitas was appointed as Director. In addition, a Cancer Research Unit funded by the South African Medical Research Council (MRC) was introduced. Between 2002 and 2009, competing burdens of disease in South Africa meant that chronic diseases, and particularly cancers, were not perceived as a priority in the country. As a result, the progress and development of the NCR-SA was arrested due to a lack of funding and human resources support. This lead to a lag in reporting of cancer incidence data, and a decline in publications. In 2009, NCR-SA was transferred to the Executive Directorship of Dr B Kistnasamy. A new Deputy Director, Dr Danuta Kielkowski was appointed in November 2010. With renewed managerial and financial support, the momentum of the NCR-SA was restored. Currently the NCR-SA has 12 cancer registry staff including cancer coders, data capturers, a quality assurance manager and an operations manager. A PhD student has been funded by the IDEA programme to conduct a cancer linkage study with HIV treatment cohorts. The Cancer Epidemiology Research Group (CERG), a subdivision of the NCR-SA, consists of a six member scientific team including two nurse field workers involved in a cancer case-control study. The lag in data capturing and analysis is being addressed with the recruitment of additional staff and automation of data capturing processes, with the goal of being up to date with data capturing by in three years time, thus in 2014 we will reach a lag time for routine reporting of two years.																						http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0256-95742015000200018									South Africa National Cancer Registry							1986																							South Africa

It is financed by the regional health agency (ARS Réunion – Mayotte).The registry covers the whole population of The reunion. The Reunion island is a French overseas territory of 2 500 km². There is no histopathology laboratory in Mayotte; all analyses are performed in The Reunion Island and all pediatric cancers diagnosed in Mayotte are treated in Reunion Island. Death certificates aren’t useful for French registries because in France, the part which contains the cause of death is anonymized.  The cancer case registration is active. For each case, inclusion criteria are controlled and data collected in medical records (see registration form). Data are coded according to IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), ENCR (European Network of Cancer Registries) and FRANCIM (French cancer registries network)guidelines, and entered into a database created in ACCESS®.																						https://afcrn.org/index.php/membership/membership-list/130-registrereunion									Registre des cancers de la Réunion							1989																							France

saecpcr-za	saecpcr	9	registry				Eastern Cape Province Cancer Registry is population-based and was established in the 1980s as a special registry by the Programme on Mycotoxin and Experimental Carcinogenesis (PROMEC) of the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC). Initially the register was set up to monitor trends in the incidence and spatial geographical variations of oesophageal cancer in four magisterial areas of the former Transkei region of the Eastern Cape Province. These were Butterworth and Centane; the so-called high incidence areas and Bizana and Lusikisiki the low incidence areas then. In 1998 the registry expanded its scope to collect data on all cancers and expanded the geographic coverage as well covering a population of eight (8) magisterial areas that include the initial four and Idutywa, Nqamakwe, Willowvale and Flagstaff. These magisterial areas are in the municipalities of Ntabankulu, Mbizana and Qaukeni in the north-eastern part of the former Transkei region and Mnquma and Mbashe in the south-western part of the region. The registry is funded mainly by the SAMRC. he registry has full time and part time personnel. Four full time personnel includes one senior scientist who manages and oversees all activities of the registry and one junior scientist who manages data. Also 3 data collectors on part time basis. They are based in major sources of data which are St Elizabeth in Lusikisiki, Mthatha General Complex (regional referral hospital) and Frere Radiation Oncology Unit (regional oncology hospital). All three ladies have basically knowledge on cancer diagnosis; training even for a short time is faster mostly introducing them to detailed information. Recently analysed data for the period 2003-2007, showed that a total of 2 808 new malignant cases were recorded of which 1 113 (39.7%) were males and 1 695 (60.3%) females. The annual number of cases was fairly consistent during this period with an annual average of 561 cases per annum.																						https://www.samrc.ac.za/sites/default/files/files/2021-03-25/CancerIncidenceEasternCape2013-2017.pdf									South Africa Eastern Cape Province Cancer Registry							1980																							South Africa

Approximately 60 000 malignant cases of cancer is registered every year in Sweden. It is compulsory for every health care provider to report newly detected cancer cases to the registry. A report has to be sent for every cancer case diagnosed at clinical-, morphological-, other laboratory examinations as well as cases diagnosed at autopsy. Since the mid-80’s there are six regional registries associated with the oncological centres in each medical region of Sweden where the registration, coding and major check-up and correction work is performed. The regionalization implies a close contact between the registry and the reporting physician, which in turn simplifies the task of correcting and checking the material.

It is located in the Department of Pathology, University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), Calabar, Cross River state, Nigeria. The registry received its first equipment from the national headquarters of cancer registries in Nigeria coordinated by professor T.F.Solanke in June 1994. This was followed by a grant from WHO/IARC for 2004-2006. In 2009, a set of computer and accessories was donated by the Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja. Since 2007, the registry has had no regular source of funding. The registry is led by a consultant pathologist as the director, and staffed by a principal administrative officer as the acting registrar, a senior clerical officer as the data collector and data-entry clerk, a medical social worker in charge of patients’ counselling. There is also an oncology nurse who counsels patients on the detection of early warning signals of cancer and assists during the collection of cervical smear and breast biopsy in the cytology clinic. Registration is predominantly active, involving visits to all the health institutions within the area of coverage. The registration area includes the following Local Government Areas(LGAS): Akamkpa, Akpabuyo, Biase, Calabar Municipality, Calabar South and Odukpani. Population-coverage is considered to be relatively complete for two of these: Calabar South & Calabar Municipality, with a population (2006 national population census) of 375,196. Based on a projected population of 501,400 in 2016, an estimate for 2016/7 was prepared assuming a constant growth of 2.9% within each age-sex group. The population is composed of three major ethnic groups, the Efik, the Ejagham and the Bekwarra. Regular visits are made to the hospital wards, health records department and laboratory departments including the haematology day care clinic at the UCTH. For logistic reasons, data collection is limited to the health facilities (such as government tertiary, secondary and primary health centres, private hospitals, clinics and laboratories) located in only three local government areas: Akpabuyo, Calabar Municipality and Calabar South.																						https://afcrn.org/index.php/membership/membership-list/123-calabar									Calabar Cancer Registry Nigeria							1979																							Nigeria

The registry employs passive methods of case finding and receives information from two semi-private institutions in Luanda. The primary data sources are the inpatient wards and oncology outpatient clinics of IACC. Additionally, records of specific cancer research studies are included. Information from the other public hospitals in Luanda, (Prenda Hospital, Central Military Hospital, Augusto Ngangula Maternity) is only included in the registry when the patient is transferred to the IACC for eventual treatment or multidisciplinary team discussion. Currently, there is no active case finding and minimal follow-up of cases performed by HBCR/IACC.																						https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839121/									Instituto Angolano de Controlo do Cancer							2007																							Angola																											
ibcr-ng	IBCR	8	registry				The Ibadan cancer registry [IBCR], University College Hospital, was started in 1960 by the late Professor G M Edington with the aim of providing cancer incidence rates for different cancer types in Ibadan and its environs. It was hoped that the data collected would give an insight into cancer in the region and highlight possible geographic variations. The registry was ab initio set up as a population-based one, covering Ibadan and its environs. It is located in the Pathology Department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. At the moment, the registry collects cases from 11 local governments within Ibadan and its environs. The eleven local government areas include Akinyele, Egbeda, Ibadan North, Ibadan North East, Ibadan North West, Ido, Lagelu, Oluyole and Ona-ara. Apart from these, the registry also receives cases from places such as Baptist Medical Centre (Ogbomosho North local Government Area), Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital, Oshogbo, Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital (Ife North Local Government area) and many of the state and privately-owned hospitals. Ibadan and environs is the capital of Oyo State which lies 70 26’ North and 30 54’ east in the forest belt of West Africa. The total registry area is 80sq. kilometer.These are the publications among others derived directly from Ibadan Cancer Registry. The cancer registry data featured in cancer incidence in five continents series volumes I, II, and III, the International Incidence of Childhood Cancer Vol. 1 and Vol. II, in journal articles and also participated in a variety of research studies, just to mention a few.																						https://afcrn.org/index.php/membership/membership-list/88-ibcr									Ibadan Cancer Registry							1960																							Nigeria

The main objective was to provide cancer diagnosis and treatment services in Afghanistan. Subsequent to establishing the first Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Center in the country housed in Jumhuriat Hospital in Kabul, there was a need to expand the cancer prevention and control activities. In January 2017, the Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Project was promoted to National Cancer Control Program (NCCP).The strategic objectives of NCCP include primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, palliative care, cancer research and surveillance (cancer registry), and capacity building in cancer prevention and control at national level. In addition to expanding the cancer diagnosis and treatment services, NCCP established the first hospital based cancer registry in 2016 followed by introducing the Kabul Cancer Registry in 2017. Moreover, NCCP is focusing on raising awareness of lay people about cancer through various campaigns on different media. Besides, NCCP is providing training program to health/medical professionals for early detection, diagnosis, proper management, and referral of cancer patients. NCCP continues to work on developing various policies for cancer prevention, establishing palliative care services, opening cancer hospital(s), especially for diagnosis and radiotherapy, developing/building capacity for cancer prevention and control.

In early 1982 the Registry was transferred from the Ministry of Health to University Teaching Hospital (UTH). A full time supervisor for the registry was appointed in 2014. Dr. Richard Nsakanya has an MPH (2009) and has worked on AIDS control and health systems management in Zambia. He is based in the Disease Surveillance & Monitoring Department in the Ministry of Health. The registry is located in an office on the first floor of the Paediatric Centre of Excellence at University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka.Death Registration is carried out in the Department of National Registration. Deaths are registered by district, based on death certificates, completed by medical staff in hospital mortuaries (to which home deaths are taken). The information on cause of death is often poorly recorded, and may be inaccurate for home deaths, of which the certifying doctor will have had little direct information.The registry has migrated from CANREG4 to CANREG5. The CANREG data entry closely follows the Notification Form (with the exception of not including the info on tobacco and alcohol, or on occupation). The registry staffs have completed a first cancer registry report which included writing section of the report and analysing cancer incidence rates for the time period 2008 to 2012 using the population projection based on census 2010																						https://afcrn.org/index.php/membership/membership-list/135-zambiacancerreigstry									Zambia National Cancer Registry							1977																							Zambia																											
zncr-zw	zncr	8	registry				The Zimbabwe National Cancer Registry (ZNCR) was established in 1985 as a result of a collaborative research agreement between the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MHCC) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organisation (WHO). This followed the acknowledgement and realisation by the MHCC that cancer had become an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and therefore a serious public health problem in Zimbabwe. The ZNCR is conveniently located in the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals complex, a large government tertiary referral centre, which provides most of the cancer management services for the northern part of the country. Although at inception the ZNCR targeted the population of the Capital City of Harare it did not exclude cancer cases from other parts of the country. After achieving complete reporting and coverage of Harare in 1990, the ZNCR has since been aiming to achieve complete reporting for the entire population of Zimbabwe.The ZNCR uses a combination of active and passive methods of case-finding. In order to register cases ZNCR staff visit institutions within the healthcare delivery system in Harare that are involved in the management of cancer patients. The Bulawayo branch of the registry reports to the ZNCR those cases recorded in the southern region of the country. Regular routine visits to the inpatient wards of the 3 government referral hospitals.The ZNCR has made 4 successive contributions to the ‘Cancer Incidence in 5 Continents’ series (Volumes 7-10) and has also contributed data to other international publications, including volume II of the ‘’International Incidence of Childhood Cancer ‘’ (IARC Scientific Publication No. 144), ‘’Cancer in Africa: Epidemiology and Prevention” (IARC Scientific Publication No. 153) and ‘’Cancer Survival in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean and Central America (IARC Scientific Publication No. 162).

gfobt	gFOBT	7	diagnosticTest				A test that checks for occult (hidden) blood in the stool. Small samples of stool are placed on special cards coated with a chemical substance called guaiac and sent to a doctor or laboratory for testing. A testing solution is put on the cards and the guaiac causes the stool sample to change color. If there is blood in the stool, the color changes very quickly. Blood in the stool may be a sign of colorectal cancer or other problems, such as polyps, ulcers, or hemorrhoids. Also called guaiac fecal occult blood test, guaiac smear test, and stool guaiac test.																						https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/gfobt									guaiac-based Fecal Occult Blood Test									colon

kscr-gh	KsCR	7	registry				The Kumasi Cancer Registry (KsCR) was established in 2004 as a hospital-based cancer registry with the aim of identifying cases of cancer seen at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH). KATH is one of the three teaching hospitals in Ghana and it is based in Kumasi, the second largest city in the country. At inception, the registry focussed on data collected from the National Centre for Nuclear and Radiation Medicine/Directorate of Oncology of KATH. Data collection was extended to include other clinical departments subsequently. The Pathology department of the hospital was not well equipped to make pathological diagnosis due to inadequate human resource and equipment. Diagnosis and management of cancers were largely based on clinical presentation with histology and other laboratory-based tests accounting for a smaller proportion of cases of cancers seen in KATH. Over the past five years, the Pathology Department has seen a remarkable improvement in the human resource situation with competent staff presently available to improve the quality of diagnosis and management of cases of cancer. The African Cancer Registry Network (AFCRN) conducted a familiarisation visit to the Kumasi Cancer Registry in 2012 with recommendation for the registry to be a population-based one. This culminated in the training of the Registry Manager in Malawi in July the same year in an AFCRN sponsored workshop. The Registry is currently established as a population-based one with abstraction of cases of cancers seen in 2012 completed and those for 2013 still ongoing. The reference population for the Registry is the city of Kumasi as designated by the 2010 Ghana Population and Housing Census. The designation ‘Kumasi’ as recorded by the Ghana Statistical Service including all localities as designated by the 2000 census will be maintained irrespective of the political re-demarcations that may follow subsequent censuses. This is to ensure consistency with the reference population.																						https://afcrn.org/index.php/membership/membership-list/99-kscr									Kumasi Cancer Registry																														Ghana

nncr-na	NNCR	7	registry				The Namibia National Cancer Registry (NNCR) was started in 1995, when Rössing Uranium mine, in co-operation with the Namibian Ministry of Health (Oncology clinic) and the Cancer Association of Namibia, collected all cancer cases reported to the Windhoek state pathology laboratory and the single existing private pathology laboratory from 1979 to 1994. From 1995 onwards, the Namibia National Cancer Registry commenced active registration of both pathology-based and clinical cases for four sentinel regions (Erongo, Oranjemund, Oshakati and Khomas). Cases that are diagnosed in South Africa are re-routed to the Namibian registry via a network of registries, which are technically supported by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The Namibia National Cancer Registry aims to provide a database of information that will ultimately lead to improved cancer prevention and control among the Namibian population.The Namibia National Cancer Registry is a population-based registry. The registry is based at the premises of the Cancer Association of Namibia (90 John Meinert Street, Windhoek-West, WINDHOEK). There is a separate office with one computer linked to a server; this is used for data entry. Transport, technical and administration support are provided by the Association, as required.The registry covers the entire population of Namibia 2,104,900 at the 2011 census. Map of Namibia shows the 13 regions and the population of each.There are five published cancer incidence in Namibia reports (1989-1994, 1995-1998, 2000-2005; and 2006-2009). The latest is the Cancer incidence in Namibia report (2010 – 2014) published in 2017.																						https://afcrn.org/index.php/membership/membership-list/125-ncr									Namibian National Cancer Registry																														Namibia

rdca-ci	RDCA	7	registry				The registry was founded in 1994. It worked for about 8 years, under the direction of the late Professor Antoine Echimane, but ceased operations in 2002. After a period of political instability in the country, recording restarted in 2011, focusing on retrospective record (since 2007) at first, but with the goal of complete data collection for 2012 in this year. The registry office is based in the Department of Oncology, including a desk for the director, a computer room and a meeting room (room A Echimane). There are 3 computers available, but only one (the one used for data entry) dedicated to the registry, an inverter, but no photocopier. The registry is the owner of a VW van (offered by an NGO), but it is out of service now and in need of repair. Currently, transportation is by public transport, or in personal vehicles.The staff are generally paid from the budget of the Department of Oncology. There is no budget for the purchase of supplies and equipment or for maintenance and replacement of equipment. A grant was received from Hoffman La Roche which has some modernization and purchase of office equipment. Transportation costs, particularly travel expenses are covered by the budget of the Service.The registry is intended to cover the city of Abidjan.																						https://afcrn.org/index.php/membership/membership-list/98-registre-des-cancers-d-abidjan									Registre des Cancers d’Abidjan																														Côte d'Ivoire

The recording work is carried out by the two young pathologists, Dr Bourama Coulibaly and Dr Ibrahim Mallé. They attended the training course in epidemiology/registration organized by IARC in 2012. However, the basic data collection is carried out by medical students, as part of their course work (preparation of mini-theses ). They visit clinical services that should generate cancer cases, and collect information on a simple registration form. Information from the pathology department is extracted from requisition/results report forms, on which the diagnosis was written (a lab notebook records specimens received, and has additional demographic information, including phone numbers). There are no operating costs for the registry, except by the pathology department. The registry collects information on all cases seen in hospitals in Bamako. It aims for full coverage of the city's population.The last population census was in 2009, at which time the population was 1,810,366.																						https://afcrn.org/index.php/membership/membership-list/136-malicancerregistry									Registre des cancers du Mali																														Mali

uccc	UCCC	7	consortium			https://www.uccancer.org/	Five of the nation’s leading comprehensive cancer centers have joined forces to form the University of California Cancer Consortium (UCCC). Each comprehensive cancer center treats all types of cancers in adults and children. Nearly half of the patients seen at a UC cancer center have late-stage cancers. These include patients diagnosed for the first time at a UC cancer center, as well as patients diagnosed elsewhere and referred by physicians to UC for specialized care. Cancer centers that achieve the National Cancer Institute (NCI) comprehensive cancer center designation frequently see patients with rare and difficult cancers who cannot be treated in other hospitals due to a lack of specific expertise or clinical trials involving the latest experimental drugs. The five NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers of the University of California bring many of the world’s top experts together for ground-breaking research, clinical trials and advanced patient care treatments. Combined, the UC Cancer Consortium administers more than a thousand clinical trials annually, connects more than tens of thousands of patients to the newest, most innovative therapies available, and works to accelerate the most promising therapies forward toward federal approval.																										2018					University of California Cancer Consortium																																																									uccancer.org

A thin, flexible tube is used to inject tiny beads that hold the radioactive substance yttrium Y 90 into the main blood vessel that carries blood to the liver. The beads collect in the tumor and in blood vessels near the tumor, and the yttrium Y 90 gives off radiation. This destroys the blood vessels that the tumor needs to grow and kills the cancer cells. Radioembolization is a type of internal radiation therapy. Also called intra-arterial brachytherapy.																						https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/radioembolization
