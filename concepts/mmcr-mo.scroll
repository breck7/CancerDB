conceptDescription The Maputo City Cancer Registry (Registo de Cancro da Cidade de Maputo) was launched in July 2014 and aims to collect all cancer cases occurring in residents from Maputo City. The Director of the Registry is Dr Cesaltina Ferreira Lorenzoni, pathologist at the Department of Pathology in Maputo Central Hospital and Director of the National Cancer Control Plan. The registry is located in the Department of Pathology, within the Maputo Central Hospital. Currently there are five registrars (Carlos Mahumane, Sérgio Manhique, Maria Emércia Marumba, Albertina Mapose, and Xavier Sitoe) assigned to the registry, and paid for by Hospital Central de Maputo. A motorcycle has been provided (and lessons for one of the registrars funded) to facilitate visits to sources outside Maputo Central Hospital. The Registry covers the whole province of Maputo City (a total area of 300 Km2), capital and largest city of Mozambique. Registration is both passive and active. Since 2015, the activities of the hospital-based and population-based registries have been merged, and the allocation of staff time re-organized to reflect the combined function as hospital based and population based registry. The databases of the two registries have been merged into a single CanReg system.
