conceptDescription The Instituto Angolano de Controlo do Cancer (IACC) Cancer Registry in Luanda, Angola is the most ancient and organized hospital-based cancer registry in Angola and provides data on cancer cases treated in several hospital facilities in Luanda.The Instituto Angolano de Controlo do Cancer (IACC) in Luanda (formerly the National Oncology Centre), is the oldest public centre for the treatment of cancer patients in Angola and hosts a hospital-based cancer registry. The registry employs passive methods of case finding and receives information from two semi-private institutions in Luanda. The primary data sources are the inpatient wards and oncology outpatient clinics of IACC. Additionally, records of specific cancer research studies are included. Information from the other public hospitals in Luanda, (Prenda Hospital, Central Military Hospital, Augusto Ngangula Maternity) is only included in the registry when the patient is transferred to the IACC for eventual treatment or multidisciplinary team discussion. Currently, there is no active case finding and minimal follow-up of cases performed by HBCR/IACC.
