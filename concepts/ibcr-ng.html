The eleven local government areas include Akinyele, Egbeda, Ibadan North, Ibadan North East, Ibadan North West, Ido, Lagelu, Oluyole and Ona-ara. Apart from these, the registry also receives cases from places such as Baptist Medical Centre (Ogbomosho North local Government Area), Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital, Oshogbo, Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital (Ife North Local Government area) and many of the state and privately-owned hospitals. Ibadan and environs is the capital of Oyo State which lies 70 26â€™ North and 30 54â€™ east in the forest belt of West Africa. The total registry area is 80sq. kilometer.These are the publications among others derived directly from Ibadan Cancer Registry. The cancer registry data featured in cancer incidence in five continents series volumes I, II, and III, the International Incidence of Childhood Cancer Vol. 1 and Vol. II, in journal articles and also participated in a variety of research studies, just to mention a few.">
