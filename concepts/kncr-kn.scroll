standsFor Kenya - Nairobi Cancer Registry
description Nairobi Cancer Registry was established in the year 2001 after consultations between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) â€“ Office of International Affairs, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Ministry of Health (MOH) and Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). It is situated at the Centre for Clinical Research (CCR), KEMRI headquarters, Nairobi. In 2009, recognising the problems of recording large numbers of cases with limited staff, an INCTR budget was established to support case finding for Nairobi residents only. The registry was a founder member of the East African Registry Network (in January 2011), and further development is on its way.
