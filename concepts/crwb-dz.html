A total number of 768 new cases has been identified, which represents a standardized incidence of 78.2 cases per 100,000. The most prevalent cancers in males were lung cancer (12.2 cases / 100,000 population), colorectal cancers and bladder cancers, respectively. In females, breast cancer was largely the most prevalent type, representing 30% of the total cancers, followed by colorectal cancers and thyroid cancer. In children aged 0 to 14, the standardized prevalence was 1.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, largely dominated by malignant blood and lymphoid organs cancers.">
