Cancer cases referred to Mulago National Referral Hospital, Uganda Cancer Institute and Radiotherapy units are followed up to have their information updated. All other hospitals and Medical Centres in Kampala where patients from northern Uganda get services are also visited to collect information about the referred patients. Data Coding: Information on each cancer patient is coded using local and universal method of classifications. For instance the coding for topography, morphology and basis of diagnosis are adopted from the ICD-O-3 coding theme. Data Entry and Cleaning: The information is entered into CanReg5, checked for consistently, duplication and errors. Data Analysis: The same software is used for analysis of the data to produce tables and graphs for various cancer incidences and prevalence.">
