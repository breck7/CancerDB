standsFor Nigerian National System of Cancer Registries
conceptDescription The Nigerian National System of Cancer Registries (NSCR) was established in 2009 as collaboration between the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria, University of Maryland, Baltimore, the Federal Ministry of Health and Health institutions in Nigeria. The main objective of the NSCR is to develop and strengthen cancer registration in Nigeria and provide data on the most common cancers, their incidence and mortality statistics to the government for policy purposes and researchers. This objective is being achieved through training, mentoring, site supervision, advocacy, troubleshooting and logistics support. NSCR works in collaboration with local and international partners including the United Statesâ€™ National Institutes of Health - National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Fogarty International Center (FIC); the International Prevention Research Institute (iPRI) Lyon, France; International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France; Society of Oncology and Cancer Research of Nigeria (SOCRON), Ibadan, Nigeria and the African Cancer Registry Network (AFCRN). NSCR plays a supervisory and mentoring role over all cancer registries in Nigeria by developing policy guidelines on cancer registration and epidemiology in Nigeria. NSCR provides technical, logistic and scientific support to cancer registries; organizes training and retraining in cancer registration, collates and analyzes cancer registry data; and disseminates findings through publications, newsletters and reports to the Federal Ministry of Health, Health institutions, researchers, mass media and all interested personnel in Nigeria. NSCR advocates for establishment of cancer registration in institutions where they are currently not present, provides support for upgrading of the Hospital-Based cancer registries to Population-Based cancer registries and strengthens Population-Based cancer registries to ensure that they are able to maintain their and improve the quality of their work.The activities of the NSCR are partly funded by IHVN-UM Capacity Development for Research into AIDS Associated Malignancies (CADRE) grant (NIH/NCI D43CA153792-01) from the National Cancer Institute.
