The registry has reached population-based level since 2000 and has been maintained with WHO assistance.Mauritius has excellent vital statistics and 100% of deaths are medically certified and ICD-10 coded. There is a unique Radiotherapy Unit and a centralized Pathology department covering the needs of the entire Health Care Delivery System, which greatly facilitate the activities of the registry.
