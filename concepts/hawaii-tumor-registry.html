As one of twenty-two NCI SEER registries nationwide, the HTR collects confidential data on cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. The HTR has been consistently recognized as a high-quality cancer registry, receiving GOLD standard awards from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). HTR cancer data are used to produce cancer incidence and mortality rates in order to track cancer trends in the state and nationally and to serve as a resource for cancer research and public health activities. With Hawaiʻi’s unique multiethnic population, the HTR has played a key role in understanding racial and ethnic differences in the burden of cancer.">
